Thank you for providing the information about the script and the error you're encountering. Let's take a look at the error and see how we can resolve it.

The error message you're seeing is:

```
EmptyFileError: Cannot open empty file: filename='/tmp/tmp69f9je9a.pdf'.
```

This error is occurring in the `process_pdfs` function, specifically when trying to open a PDF file using PyMuPDF (fitz). The error suggests that the file being opened is empty.

There are a few potential reasons for this issue:

1. The uploaded file might be empty.
2. There might be an issue with how the file is being saved temporarily before processing.
3. There could be a problem with file permissions or how Streamlit is handling the file upload.

Let's modify the `process_pdfs` function to add some error handling and debugging information. Here's an updated version of the function:



```python
def process_pdfs(uploaded_files, api_key):
    results = []
    projects = []
    client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
        st.write(f"Processing file: {uploaded_file.name}")
        st.write(f"File size: {uploaded_file.size} bytes")
        
        try:
            with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".pdf") as tmp_file:
                tmp_file.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
                tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name
            
            st.write(f"Temporary file created: {tmp_file_path}")
            st.write(f"Temporary file size: {os.path.getsize(tmp_file_path)} bytes")
            
            if os.path.getsize(tmp_file_path) == 0:
                st.error(f"The file {uploaded_file.name} is empty. Skipping this file.")
                continue
            
            doc = fitz.open(tmp_file_path)
            
            for i in range(len(doc)):
                page = doc.load_page(i)
                text = page.get_text()
                text = remove_special_characters(text)
                
                analysis = analyze_page(text, client)
                
                result = {
                    'filename': uploaded_file.name,
                    'page': i + 1,
                    'summary': analysis.get('Summary', 'N/A'),
                    'include_or_exclude': analysis.get('Include or Exclude', 'N/A'),
                    'reason': analysis.get('Reason', 'N/A')
                }
                
                if analysis.get('Include or Exclude', '').lower() == 'include':
                    page_projects = extract_projects(text, client)
                    projects.extend([(uploaded_file.name, i + 1, project) for project in page_projects])
                
                results.append(result)
                
                # Add a progress indicator
                progress = (i + 1) / len(doc)
                st.progress(progress)
            
            doc.close()
            os.unlink(tmp_file_path)
        
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"An error occurred while processing {uploaded_file.name}: {str(e)}")
            continue
    
    return results, projects

```

This updated version of the `process_pdfs` function includes several improvements:

1. It adds more detailed logging using `st.write()` to show the progress of file processing.
2. It checks if the temporary file is empty before trying to open it with PyMuPDF.
3. It wraps the entire processing of each file in a try-except block to catch and report any errors without crashing the entire process.

To use this updated function, you'll need to replace the existing `process_pdfs` function in your `app.py` file with this new version.

Additionally, make sure that the PDF files you're uploading are not empty and are valid PDF files. The error you're seeing suggests that an empty file is being uploaded or created during the process.

If you're still encountering issues after making these changes, please try the following:

1. Upload a single, known-good PDF file and see if it processes correctly.
2. Check if there are any permission issues in the directory where Streamlit is running.
3. Ensure that you have the latest versions of the required libraries installed, especially PyMuPDF and Streamlit.

If the problem persists, please provide more information about the PDF files you're trying to upload (size, number of pages, etc.) and any additional error messages you might see after implementing these changes.
